<h1> Unit 1 Outcome 1</h1>

<h2 class="1.1">1.1 - Describe the purpose of IT in a modern business</h2>

<p>The purpose of IT in modern business is to encourage innovation because innovation in business has the same impact that steam had on the industrial revolution. Innovation results in smarter apps, better data storing and increased processing power. IT makes businesses rum more smoothly and increases value and enhances quality. 
</p>
<br>

<h2 class="1.2">1.2 Describing methods, skills and rescources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>

<p>The skills needed to complete digital projects are wide and varied. Several skills are acquired through basic work experience and collaboration. Such skills like time management, resource management, planning, organising and communication management can be developed in almost any role. 

A project requires a strategic understanding and perspective of why the project should be done and the technology used to achieve the goal, and that goal is is to find solutions for clients or customers. What would also make the project successful is clear project goals, a good team and support from the management.  
</p>

<h2 class="1.3">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>

<p>I would use a planning application such as trello to set the layout of my website as well as the headings and sub headings of each of the individual pages. I would then use a programme such as word to write and edit the content of those pages to make sure all the relevant information is there. 
</p>

<h2 class="1.4">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>

<p>What causes digital projects to fail is can sometimes be fairly simple. According to Enginess, they think that the main problem is that “to digitally transform or run a successful digital project requires significant collaboration”, meaning that reasons for failure are relatively simple. Manchester Digital also says “Collaboration is also crucial. Companies today must meet – and ideally exceed – the expectations of fickle, highly-empowered consumers at their every point of contact with the business.”

Furthermore, some more common risks are: Short term priorities taking over,undefined strategy, and giving yourself too much work to do.
    
These risks raise an issue in 21st century digital projects. Today, the conditions in which we operate in are rather challenging and even though we know that we need to consistently developed innovate, is the difficulty to do so, whilst running a business, too great?
</p>

<h2 class="1.5">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>

<p>Firstly, I would evaluate the systems and software available to me by researching outside opinions and the ease of use. Secondly, I would then match the software to the system requirements to see which would run best on each. Thirdly, I would then acquire the most useful system and software that would allow me to do the job correctly and in a timely fashion. 
</p>

<h2 class="1.6"> Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achive your outcomes</h2>

<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform which allows users to host their code and digital projects, in a team or individually as well as ongoing, numerous amendments which Github will automatically identify and change accordingly. This means that the most current version is always accessible. Each time an upload is made, GitHub prompts the user to add a commit message so anyone who sees the project, can see when the changes have been made.
</p>

<h2 class="1.7">Describe legal guidlines and consstraints that impact digital projects</h2>

<p>For digital projects we have to consider GDPR. With the implementation of GDPR, we are now required to be more sensitive when building websites and services and the data we collect and use alongside them. Whilst the regulation does cover internal and external individuals, it is mainly for business to client relationships. This impacts what you can and can’t do with data and how long it can be stored. Consent is needed and the client is given the power to allow and remove control a lot more than before. These requirements should see these changes as a chance to build better relationships built on transparency and trust.
