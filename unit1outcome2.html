<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>

<h2 class="2.1">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>

<p>The tools that I used to make my own website were clear to use and made creating a website much simpler than I though it would be. Overall, I thought that there could be more built in aids to Visual Studio Code as it was difficult trying to find out why my code wasn't working. What was useful was how different actions and titles where in different colours which helped make the code easier to read when going through it. Other tools that were used were online resources. These resources helped when I couldn't find out what was wrong and helped us by showing us working code and how it worked with simple explainations. I personally did not use Trello, I preffered ToDoist as it was a tool I was most familiar with and knew how to use it from past experiece. These resources were useful in building my website as they aided me and my eyesight by colourising things to make them standout and underlining the mistakes or missing bits of code that I hadn't closed before moving on. They're are quite usefull.</p>

<h2 class="2.2">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>

<p>In my opinion, the tools selected were good  Visual Studio Code, Slack and Zoom were useful to a point as there's only so much you can do online instead of a class room. Nonetheless, they were still allowed me to be productive enough to finish the project.</p>

<h2 class="2.3">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h2>

<p>I am happy with my website and I’m also unhappy. I feel like it’s under thought out and if I’d had more time to really think about how I wanted my website, it could look much better. For example, I’d change the nav-bar and put a heading with its own subheading for a much cleaner look and I’d add a neutral background colour instead of an image for simplicity when coding. 
</p>

<h2 class="2.4">2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your projects</h2>

<p>I’d connect my social media pages by adding the logo of that company and make that a button so that would take you to my pages, I’d also create a single page for a blog and then add the subheadings to the page.

I'd also work in a small team so that we can split up the work between us 
</p>

<h2 class="2.5">2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they are fit for purpose</h2>

<p>The outcomes that I had were good. They work well and are fit for purpose. To make sure that this was true, I tested the links to make sure that they opened in a different tab on my browser and that the content for the website made sense and fit the webpage, as well as looking for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. </p>
