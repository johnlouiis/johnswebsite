<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 3</h1>

<h2 class="3.1">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h2>

<p>In Visual Studio Code, there could be more help when it comes to correcting code. Sometimes it’s hard to see the errors as a human and we become stifled and confused as to why it’s not working. It would speed up trouble shooting and be more efficient. If we had done it in teams, I feel as if the websites would’ve been much cleaner and more help would’ve been available if a person was stuck and need help.</p>

<h2 class="3.2">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>

<p>A few ways to improve these are to complete tasks in batches, keep a detailed list of daily tasks, prioritise the most important ones and check them off once completed. This will help streamline a day of work into smaller tasks, helping you increase productivity my making you go item by item and only thinking about the current task.

Whats more is taking regular breaks can improve concentration. Short breaks during long tasks can help maintain a constant level of performance. </p>

<h2 class="3.3">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h2>

<p>What I’d do differently next time is remind myself to take breaks more often and step back so I can come back to the project with a clear head. This would make it easier to spot mistakes and and remedy any problems within the code or in the content of the website.</p>

<h2 class="3.4">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

<p>I would set out an effective plan that’s defined and documented and create a testing strategy that includes items such as: the scope of testing, deadlines, risk identification, and objectives. I’d also set out what needs to be tested and the steps needed to betaken so the plan is most effective in its execution.</p>
