<h1>Unit 2 Outcome 2</h1>

<h2 class="1.1">1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>

<p>The homepage will be simple with a simple background image on the page, welcoming you. There will be a nav-bar with buttons to an about me page as well as a contact me page, unit 1, unit 2 and a review section.</p>

<h2 class="1.5">1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>

<p>An example would be stock images or objects. Licenses are granted by an authority to allow its use e.g. the use and distribution of resources by the owner. I may decide to offer an image for free or a price. Either way, I can include a license to limit usage and I’d maintain the copyright. Copyrighting gives the creative artist (me) control of the original work. I have to give permission before someone uses it. Licensing gives the website permission to use an image for their own reasons. These constraints have to be factored in or there could be legal repercussions and the removal of the website.</p> 

<h2 class="1.6">1.6 Describe access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>

<p>There are a variety of issues that need tone taken into account such as deafness or blindness. These two disabilities can be aided by audio description and subtitles on videos. A good way to increase the availability of websites is to post tips that users can use to implement on their own computer or browser. The BBC had a great example of this before the webpages was archived. http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/

Broken down into multiple sections the BBC website offered support based on the disability of the user. It’s a great example of disability friendliness.

Using this an example, I would add items such as  audio description, chnage the colour of the website background and the font to make it easier to understand.  </p>

<h2 class="1.7">1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>

<p>The best file types for websites are JPEG, PNG, GIF and SVG because they contain a lossless compression.</p>
